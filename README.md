# Django_multi_projects
This was just for learning purposes, we can implement other functionality also.

This Project contains multiple Mini projects, using Django features like Templates, Signals, Emails, ORM, Custom user model, login, logout, Register, etc.

Veggies - The project contains mainly CRUD operations in recipes, users will register, login, and Read/ Create/ Update/ Delete recipes with images. After doing tasks log out.

Student - Student Management System, where we have a set of student and their marks, we can get their ranks, and an email also can be sent to student.

To use, you need to install all the dependencies, I added Venv for ease of use, DB file is also there. If you make changes in the Model, run migrations.
Run the project - Python manage.py runserver
URLs are mentioned in Url.py file
